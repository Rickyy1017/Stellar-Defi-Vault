//! NFT-triggered position exit (issue #410).
//!
//! Builds on the stake-receipt NFT contract (`nft.rs`, issue #26): lets a
//! receipt holder exit their staking position by burning the NFT itself,
//! instead of calling `unstake`/`unstake_all` directly.
//!
//! # Adapting to the actual receipt contract
//!
//! The issue's acceptance criteria describes `redeem_nft(user, nft_id: u32)`
//! verifying ownership via `owner_of(nft_id)` and burning a specific token
//! id. `StakeReceiptNFT` (`nft.rs`) doesn't work that way: it's a
//! non-transferable receipt keyed directly by holder `Address` (`mint`/
//! `burn`/`has_receipt` all take a `user: Address`, not a token id), with no
//! `nft_id` or `owner_of` concept at all. `burn_and_redeem` is written
//! against that real interface instead: the caller redeems *their own*
//! receipt, which is exactly the receipt tied to their address â€” there is no
//! separate id to look up, and "wrong owner" is rejected the same way every
//! other entrypoint here rejects it, via `user.require_auth()` plus
//! requiring a receipt/position to exist for that address.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! Reuses `balance::get_nft_contract` / `set_nft_contract` (issue #40),
//! which already exist but were never wired to a public entrypoint â€” added
//! here since `burn_and_redeem` cannot function without a way to register
//! the receipt contract.
