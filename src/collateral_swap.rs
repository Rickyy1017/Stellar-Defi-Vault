//! Collateral swap without unstaking (issue #335).
//!
//! Lets a staker swap their underlying collateral token for a different one
//! while keeping their position (and, per the issue, an active debt-NFT
//! loan) open â€” unstake the old token, swap via DEX, re-stake the result,
//! all without closing the loan.
//!
//! # A real gap this module is built against
//!
//! The issue depends on issue #214 ("NFT collateral minting" â€” a debt-NFT
//! representing an open loan against a staked position). That doesn't exist
//! in this crate: `DebtNFT` is referenced by name in `vault.rs`'s imports
//! but is never defined anywhere in `storage.rs`, and there is no minting,
//! `face_value`, or loan-tracking code at all (see this PR's description for
//! the wider picture of what does and doesn't exist here). "Validates debt
//! NFT exists and position is collateralized" and "debt NFT face_value
//! updated" from the acceptance criteria cannot be implemented against real
//! data as a result.
//!
//! What *does* exist and is used here: `balance::get_dex_router`/
//! `vault::DexRouterClient` (issue #205), and `DataKey::StakedAtLedger` as a
//! stand-in signal for "this user has an open position" (not "is
//! collateralized" specifically â€” there's no collateralization flag to
//! check). `CollateralSwapConfig` tracks the swap's own before/after state
//! directly rather than updating a debt-NFT's `face_value`, since there's no
//! debt NFT to update.
//!
//! Also unstakes/re-stakes are unavailable for the same reason documented
//! throughout this PR (no live `stake`/`unstake` entrypoint) â€” this module
//! swaps the *token* via the DEX router directly rather than round-tripping
//! through unstake-then-stake, since that round trip has nothing to call.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! `DataKey` sits at Soroban's 50-variant cap, so this uses raw `Symbol`-keyed
//! storage, matching `vesting_cliff.rs`.
