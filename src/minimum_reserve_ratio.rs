//! Minimum reward-reserve ratio floor (issue #405).
//!
//! Enforces a hard floor under the reward token balance: it must always keep
//! at least `ratio_bps` of total outstanding (accrued-but-unclaimed) reward
//! obligations in reserve. A claim that would breach the floor is capped at
//! whatever headroom remains above it; the rest is queued rather than paid.
//!
//! # Wiring
//!
//! Like `epoch_reward_cap.rs` (issue #270, whose `claim_epoch_capped_reward`
//! this mirrors) and `compound_optimizer.rs`, this exposes its own capped
//! claim entrypoint (`claim_with_reserve_floor`) rather than editing the
//! existing `claim()` flow in `vault.rs`, keeping the floor opt-in and
//! additive. Per this issue's own notes, any amount deferred by the floor is
//! queued into the *same* `epoch_reward_cap::DeferredReward(Address)` bucket
//! epoch_reward_cap uses, claimable through the existing
//! `claim_deferred_reward()` entrypoint â€” whichever guardrail (epoch cap or
//! reserve floor) binds first, the overflow lands in one place.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! `DataKey` is at Soroban's 50-variant cap, so this uses raw `Symbol`-keyed
//! instance storage, matching `balance.rs`.
