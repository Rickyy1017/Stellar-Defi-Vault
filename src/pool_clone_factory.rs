//! Pool clone factory (issue #412).
//!
//! Lets the admin deploy a fresh, independent instance of this same pool
//! contract from within a running pool, instead of redeploying bytecode by
//! hand for every new pool. The new instance is initialized immediately
//! with the supplied configuration and registered as a sibling pool in this
//! contract's league (`add_league_pool`, cross-pool registry from issue
//! #373 / `performance_league_table.rs`), so it's immediately visible to
//! cross-pool queries.
//!
//! # Wiring
//!
//! `deploy_clone` needs the Wasm hash of the code to deploy. Soroban gives
//! a contract no way to read back its own currently-executing Wasm hash, so
//! the caller supplies it (this contract's own hash, already uploaded to
//! the network via `env.deployer().upload_contract_wasm()`).
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! `DataKey` sits at Soroban's 50-variant cap, so this uses raw
//! `Symbol`-keyed storage, matching `balance.rs`.
