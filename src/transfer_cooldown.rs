//! Transfer cooldown ΓÇö a waiting period before the recipient of a
//! transferred position can unstake it (issue #340).
//!
//! Builds on issues #29 (`transfer_position`) and #97
//! (`transfer_position_with_rewards`). Without a cooldown, a transfer could
//! be used to route around the sender's lock-up or holding period entirely.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! `DataKey` is at Soroban's 50-variant cap, so this uses raw `Symbol`-keyed
//! storage, matching `balance.rs`.
//!
//! # Known gap
//!
//! `transfer_position` and `transfer_position_with_rewards` are currently
//! missing from `src/vault.rs` on `main` (see PR description ΓÇö an unrelated
//! bad merge truncated most of that file). This module exposes
//! [`record_transfer_received`] and [`assert_transfer_cooldown_cleared`] as
//! free functions specifically so that, once those two entrypoints are
//! restored, they only need to add one call each:
//!
//! - the end of a successful transfer: `transfer_cooldown::record_transfer_received(&env, &recipient);`
//! - the top of `unstake`: `transfer_cooldown::assert_transfer_cooldown_cleared(&env, &user)?;`
//! - the top of a full unstake / re-stake path: `transfer_cooldown::clear_transfer_received(&env, &user);`
//!
//! Until then, [`check_transfer_cooldown`] (the same assertion, exposed as a
//! contract entrypoint) and [`get_transfer_cooldown_remaining`] are directly
//! callable and tested on their own.
