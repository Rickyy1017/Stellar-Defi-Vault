//! Active compound-interval optimizer (issue #338).
//!
//! Distinct from issue #185 (read-only optimal-claim-frequency advisory):
//! this lets a user opt in to having a keeper *execute* claim-and-restake at
//! the mathematically optimal interval, rather than just being told what
//! that interval is.
//!
//! Optimal interval = `sqrt(2 * tx_cost / (rate * position))`, adapted to
//! integer ledgers â€” the classic EOQ-style tradeoff between "claim often,
//! pay tx cost every time" and "claim rarely, leave more rewards uncompounded
//! for longer".
//!
//! # Wiring
//!
//! `trigger_optimized_compound` is specified to "claim and restake" â€” this
//! crate has no live `claim`/`stake`/`restake` entrypoint to call yet (see
//! this PR's description). The function here does everything up to that
//! point (auth, interval-elapsed gate, interval recalculation, event, and
//! the keeper incentive bookkeeping) and returns the amount that *would* be
//! claimed (`balance::get_accrued_reward`) rather than performing a token
//! transfer that doesn't have a real claim path to route through yet.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! `DataKey` sits at Soroban's 50-variant cap, so this uses raw `Symbol`-keyed
//! storage, matching `vesting_cliff.rs`.
