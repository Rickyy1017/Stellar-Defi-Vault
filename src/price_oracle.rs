//! Position price oracle (issue #290).
//!
//! Publishes the fair value of a staking position â€” principal plus accrued
//! rewards â€” as an on-chain reference price, so a secondary market trading
//! stake receipts or debt NFTs has something to quote against.
//!
//! The price is **informational only**. Nothing in this module feeds back into
//! staking, reward, or withdrawal logic; publishing a price can never change
//! what a position is actually worth on redemption.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! `DataKey` sits at Soroban's 50-variant cap, so history is kept under raw
//! `Symbol`-keyed persistent storage, matching `balance.rs`.
