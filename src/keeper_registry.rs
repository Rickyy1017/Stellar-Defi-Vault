//! Keeper registry.
//!
//! Several keeper-triggered flows (e.g. `compound_optimizer.rs`'s
//! `trigger_optimized_compound`) rely on an arbitrary caller-supplied
//! `keeper: Address` with no notion of approval or track record. This module
//! adds a formal registry: which keeper addresses are admin-approved, and
//! their historical trigger count / total earnings, so keeper-triggered
//! entrypoints can gate on `is_registered_keeper` instead of trusting any
//! caller.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! `DataKey` sits at Soroban's 50-variant cap, so this uses raw `Symbol`-keyed
//! storage, matching `balance.rs`.
