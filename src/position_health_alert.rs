//! Unified position health alert (issue #377).
//!
//! Stakers may be unaware their position needs attention until it's too
//! late — a lock or an admin-configured max stake duration (issue #232)
//! elapsing, a stake-backed loan (issue #261) drifting toward liquidation,
//! or the epoch reward cap (issue's own `epoch_reward_cap.rs`) about to
//! truncate their next claim. This module checks all four conditions in one
//! call and emits a single structured event when any of them fire, instead
//! of requiring a frontend to poll several unrelated getters.
//!
//! Read-only: no storage is written. `needs_attention` is the OR of the four
//! flags so a caller can branch on it alone.
