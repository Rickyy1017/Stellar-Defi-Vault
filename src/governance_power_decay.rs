//! Governance voting power decay for long-inactive participants (issue #404).
//!
//! Builds on issue #160 (governance voting) and the `GovernanceProposal` /
//! `vote_weight_at` groundwork already in `storage.rs` / `vault.rs`. A staker
//! whose position compounds for a long time but never actually votes
//! accumulates outsized voting power with no corresponding participation,
//! which is a centralization risk. This module decays the *effective* vote
//! weight reported for a user the longer they go without voting, without
//! touching their underlying staked position or rewards.
//!
//! # Wiring
//!
//! There is currently no callable `vote()` / `create_proposal()` entrypoint
//! on `main` to hook a "last voted" update into â€” `GovernanceProposal` and
//! `ProposableParam` exist as storage types (see `storage.rs`, `balance.rs`)
//! but nothing in this crate currently creates or votes on one (same gap
//! documented by `transfer_cooldown.rs` for `transfer_position`). So, matching
//! that module's approach, this exposes [`record_governance_vote`] as the one
//! call a restored `vote()` would need to add at the point a vote is cast,
//! and [`get_effective_vote_weight`] as the query any governance weight
//! lookup (a restored `vote()`, or the existing `vote_weight_at`/
//! `total_vote_weight`) would call instead of a user's raw position amount.
//! Both are directly callable and tested on their own in the meantime.
//!
//! # Epoch length
//!
//! The issue's `set_governance_decay_config` signature carries no epoch
//! length parameter, so "epoch" here uses the same day-length unit already
//! established for runway/reward calculations in `vault.rs`
//! (`LEDGERS_PER_DAY`) rather than introducing a second, decay-specific
//! epoch length to configure.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! `DataKey` sits at Soroban's 50-variant cap, so this uses raw `Symbol`-keyed
//! storage, matching `balance.rs` and `reputation_decay.rs`.
