//! Commitâ€“reveal stake commitments (issue #288).
//!
//! Lets a staker commit to an amount without revealing it, then reveal and
//! stake later. A large stake intention is no longer telegraphed in the
//! mempool, which removes the front-running window and gives whale stakers a
//! privacy layer.
//!
//! The commitment is `SHA256(amount_bytes || salt)`. The salt is what makes it
//! meaningful: without one, the space of plausible stake amounts is small
//! enough to brute-force straight off the hash.
//!
//! # What this does and does not hide
//!
//! It hides the amount *between commit and reveal*. It is not zero-knowledge:
//! the reveal publishes the amount, and the resulting stake is as visible as
//! any other. The `commitment_revealed` event deliberately carries no amount,
//! but the balance change it accompanies is public regardless.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! `DataKey` sits at Soroban's 50-variant cap, so this uses raw `Symbol`-keyed
//! storage, matching `balance.rs`.
