//! Cross-pool performance league table (issue #373).
//!
//! Builds on issue #276 (competitive seasons). Each pool publishes its own
//! per-season performance metrics on-chain, and the league table is queried
//! from this contract's own storage. Sibling pools registered in the league
//! are read via the `IStakingPool` cross-contract interface (issue #260 /
//! `interface.rs`), giving callers a single ranked view across pools for any
//! completed season.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! - Each pool tracks its own `PoolSeasonStats` under a per-season key.
//! - At season end (via `publish_season_performance()`), the admin records
//!   final metrics for the just-completed season.
//! - `get_performance_league_table(season_start)` returns this pool's entry
//!   plus entries from up to `MAX_LEAGUE_POOLS` sibling pools queried via
//!   cross-contract calls, sorted descending by `total_rewards_distributed`.
//! - Sibling pool addresses are managed through `add_league_pool()` /
//!   `remove_league_pool()` (admin only).
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! `DataKey` is at Soroban's 50-variant cap â€” all keys use raw `Symbol`-keyed
//! or tuple-keyed storage, matching the pattern in `balance.rs` and other
//! feature modules.
