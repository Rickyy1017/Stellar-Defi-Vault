//! Automated pool-level TVL-tiered rate rebalancing (issue #333).
//!
//! Distinct from issue #182 (per-user tier rebalancing) and issue #233 (TVL
//! smoothing, which keeps emission constant): this steps the *base*
//! `reward_rate_bps` discretely as total pool TVL crosses admin-configured
//! thresholds â€” higher TVL triggers a lower rate to preserve reward-token
//! sustainability as more capital chases the same emission budget.
//!
//! # Wiring
//!
//! The issue specifies `check_and_rebalance_rate()` runs automatically
//! "inside `stake` and `unstake` after position update" â€” this crate has no
//! live `stake`/`unstake` entrypoint to call it from yet (see this PR's
//! description). `check_and_rebalance_rate` is implemented as a public
//! function ready to be called from wherever that lands, and is also exposed
//! directly so it can be triggered standalone (e.g. by a keeper) in the
//! meantime.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! `DataKey` sits at Soroban's 50-variant cap, so this uses raw `Symbol`-keyed
//! storage, matching `vesting_cliff.rs`. Thresholds are stored as a single
//! `Vec` under one key rather than per-threshold entries â€” the issue caps
//! the list at 5, so there's no per-entry storage-growth concern that would
//! motivate splitting it.
