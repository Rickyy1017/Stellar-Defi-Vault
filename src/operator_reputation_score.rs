//! Cross-pool operator reputation scoring (issue #442).
//!
//! A pool operator's admin address accumulates a reputation score based on
//! how well they manage all their pools: uptime, solvency maintenance,
//! governance participation, slash dispute outcomes, and community ratings.
//! The score is visible to prospective stakers evaluating new pools.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! `DataKey` is at Soroban's 50-variant cap, so this uses raw `Symbol`-keyed
//! storage, matching `balance.rs`.
