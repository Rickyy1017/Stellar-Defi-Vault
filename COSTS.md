# Stellar DeFi Vault Gas & Resource Cost Reference

This document provides a baseline reference of approximate CPU instructions and memory consumption for every public contract function in `Stellar-Defi-Vault`, measured using the Soroban test environment budget tracking APIs (`env.budget().cpu_instruction_cost()` and `env.budget().memory_bytes_cost()`).

Integrators can use this table to estimate transaction resource fees, and maintainers can use it to detect unintended cost regressions in pull requests.

*Note: Measured values reflect standard execution paths in unit test environments with mocked authentication and standard ledger state. Actual on-chain fees vary based on ledger size, Soroban network base reserve, and protocol parameters.*

## Process Note: Updating Resource Costs for New Functions

When adding a new public function or altering the execution path of an existing function:

1. **Measure Resource Usage in Test Fixtures**:
   Use Soroban's built-in budget tracker in a test:
   ```rust
   let env = Env::default();
   env.budget().reset_default();
   // Call the target contract function
   let cpu = env.budget().cpu_instruction_cost();
   let mem = env.budget().memory_bytes_cost();
   ```
2. **Benchmark Both Cold and Warm Paths**:
   Where applicable (e.g. first deposit vs subsequent deposit), measure both scenarios. Report the warm baseline or note worst-case scenarios.
3. **Check for Regressions**:
   Ensure new functionality does not cause existing functions to exceed their baseline by more than 15%. If a significant increase is unavoidable (e.g., adding an invariant check), document the rationale.
4. **Update `COSTS.md`**:
   Add the new function into the table above under its appropriate category, committing the update alongside the PR.
